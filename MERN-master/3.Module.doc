1) In JS, one Module is called one Javascript file
2) Node.js has set of built-in modules which we can use without any installation
3) By using fs( File System) we can manipulate files and folders.
4) we can import modules in nodejs by using require() method

   using require() function

   Ex:
   //Importing a built in modules
    const fs = require('fs');
      

    // importing a module from file
    const myModule = require("./myModule");
