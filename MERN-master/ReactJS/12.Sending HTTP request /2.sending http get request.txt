1) In React App, we can use fetch, and axios for sending http requests
2) fetch -
   1. fetch is a web API for making HTTP requests
   2. Although It's not react specific
   3. It used to fetch data from server or external sources
   4. fetch API is promise based

   Ex-  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/100')
        .then(response=>{
            if(!response.ok)
                throw new Error("Network response is not Ok")
        })
        .then(data=>{
            setData(data);
        })
        .catch(error=>{
            setError("Data not fetched")
        })

3) axios -
   1. axios is a popular javascript library
   2. axios is used to make HTTP requests
   3. It provides a more robust and flexible way to interact with APIs compared to the native fetch API.
   4. Axios is used to fetch data from a server, send data to a server, or perform various other HTTP operations. 
   5. Axios is promise based
   6. It automatically transform data into JSON
   
   Ex -

      import axios from 'axios';

      axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/100')
      .then(response=>{
          setData(response.data);
      })
      .catch(error=>[
          setError(error)
      ])
