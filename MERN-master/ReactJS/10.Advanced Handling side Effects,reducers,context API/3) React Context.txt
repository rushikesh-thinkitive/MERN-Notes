1) The React Context API is a feature in React that allows you to create a global state or share data across multiple components without 
   having to pass props through every level of the component tree.
2) It provides a way to communicate between components that are nested at different levels, making it easier to manage state in complex React applications.
3) Why Use the Context API?

   In React, when you need to share data across multiple components, you usually pass data through props. This works well for simple cases, but 
   when you have deeply nested components, it can lead to "prop drilling," where you have to pass props through several levels, even when intermediate
   components don't need them.

   The Context API solves this problem by creating a central place for certain data, allowing you to "subscribe" to that data in any component
   without needing to pass props through every level.
