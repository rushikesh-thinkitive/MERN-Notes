1) Redux is an open source javascript library
2) Redux is used to manage application state 
3) It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.
4) Here, In react Redux toolkit is more popular to manage state in efficient way
5) why we should use Redux -

   suppose, there is a parent child hierarchy, means 1 parent ke 10 right child hai and 7 left child so agar muze
   last 2 dono sub tree me in state ko use krna ho to hm data ko props ke through pass krkr use krskte hai but 
   between childs me hm unnecessary data ko pass kr rhe hai
   
   so isse bachne ke liye hm ReactContext ka use kr skte hai so isse hm directly kisi bhi child me data ko access
   krr skte hai, but isses bhi easy and popular way hai i.e Redux toolkit

6) Redux provide us a store in which we will store data
7) and we can use that data anywhere even if not parent child relationship between components
8) Therefore redux is called as centralized state management
