1) Refs in React allow you to directly access a DOM element or a React component instance, providing a bridge to interact with the rendered output. 
2) Ex - usecases - 
   Focus an Input
   Control a video or audio element
3) refs in functional components is using the useRef hook


Note - for simple forms or when direct control isn't necessary, uncontrolled components can be a quick and effective solution.
