cors -> cross origin resource sharing

1) when we try to share resources across same domain (on same port no) which client and server side have so that 
   time we can pass data without any error
2) But if the port no of client side and server side is different then cors error occur
   because, we cant share resources across different domains
3) But In REST api, we need to share resources across domain
4) so, to overcome from this error we need to include middleware, 
   app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    res.setHeaders('Access-Control-Allow-origin','*'),    // allow all domain to request to server
    res.setHeaders('Access-Control-Allow-Methods','GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE'), 
    res.setHeaders('Access-Control-Allow-Headers','Content-Type, Authorization'), 
    next();
   })
