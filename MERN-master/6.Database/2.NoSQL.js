/*

1) NoSQL database means Not Only SQL
2) NoSQL doesn't have fixed strong schema, In NoSQL, structure of each document can be different
2) here, database is set of collection
3) Collection means tables
4) document means record (data)
5) In NoSQL DB, there is no relation between them
6) So duplicasy of data is possible
7) Horizontal and Vertical scaling are possible

Note: We can make relation between document but because of relation it becomes slow
