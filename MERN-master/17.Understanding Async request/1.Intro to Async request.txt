1) In ExpressJS, Handling asynchronous request efficiently is crucial for building scalable and responsive application
2) Asynchronous requests are used when performing operations that may take some time to complete 
   Ex -  querying to Database
         making HTTP request to external API
         performing I/O file operations

3) To do this, we use async and await to handle this kind of tasks
4) suppose, there is request which fetch data(1000 records) from database so that time we will make that 
   request asynchronous. because it is time consuming process.
