1) To access web application, you need a web server.
2) Web server will handle all the http request for the web application.

3) eg.IIS is a web server ASP.NET application
   Tomcat is a web server in PHP and Java web applications
4) Node JS provides capability to create your own web server that can handle HTTP request asynchronously.
5) we can use IIS,tomcat to handle HTTP request in nodeJS application but creating our own web server is recommended.

6) The http.createServer() method includes request and response parameters which is supplied by nodeJS
7) The request object can be used to get information about the current HTTP request
   Ex:  url,request header and data

8) The response object can be used to send a response for a current HTTP request
9) If the response from the http server is supposed to be displayed as HTML,
   You should include an HTTP header with correct content type


HTTP :

1) HTTP is a module in nodejs
2) HTTP module allows to transfer data over the HTTP.
3) to include HTTP: 
    const http = require('http');
