For rendering HTML pages according to route we need to load HTML pages at nodejs.

1) All HTML files are stored in public folder.
2) and we need to access it in index.JS

Ex:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const path = require('path');

const dirName = path.join(__dirname,'public');

app.use(express.static(dirName));               // This method load static content of the project in index.js (images,audios,pdf,html files etc)

app.listen(8000);



where, use -> is a middleware
       static -> load static content of the project
