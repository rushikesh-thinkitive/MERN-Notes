1) Authentication - 
    Authentication is like proving who you are when you want to access something.
    Think of it like showing your ID card to enter a restricted area. You're proving your identity to gain access.
    In the digital world, authentication usually involves providing a username and password, or sometimes using other methods like fingerprint or facial recognition.
    Once you're authenticated successfully, you're granted access to certain resources or areas of an application.

2) Authorization - 

    Authorization is like deciding what you're allowed to do after you've proven who you are.
    It's like being given different levels of access based on your identity or role.
    For example, in a school, students might be authorized to enter the library and borrow books, but they might not be authorized to access the teacher's lounge.
    In the digital world, authorization determines what actions you can perform or what data you can access within an application or system.
    It's often based on your role or permissions assigned to you. For example, an admin might have more permissions than a regular user.
